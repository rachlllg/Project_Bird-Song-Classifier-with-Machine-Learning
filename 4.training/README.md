The notebooks in this folder covers the training steps performed for the project. Please follow the steps outlined in the 0.dataset, 1.preprocessing, and 3.model_prep to download, preprocess, and prepare the dataset before attempting the notebooks in this folder.

All work was performed in Google Colab with files streamed from Google Drive. To run the notebooks, be sure to upload the corresponding datasets to your Google Drive and update the directory paths in the notebooks as needed. 

Note that the notebooks in b1.Random_Forest utilized the class methods created in 3.model_prep/b.class_methods.ipynb to extract the framed audios, features, and labels, all notesbooks thereafter utilized the pre-extracted features and labels from the 3.model_prep/d.extract_features_labels.ipynb.
