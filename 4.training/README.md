# 4.training

The notebooks in this folder covers the model training steps performed for the project. Please follow the steps outlined in the 0.dataset, 1.preprocessing, 3.model_prep to download and preprocess the dataset before attempting the notebooks in this folder.

All work was performed in Google Colab with files streamed from Google Drive. To run the notebooks, be sure to upload the corresponding datasets to your Google Drive and update the directory paths in the notebooks as needed. 

Note that the class methods and exporting the framed audios and features/labels to pickle formats are not strictly neccessary to run the models, but without these steps, you may face memory issues so they are highly recommended.
